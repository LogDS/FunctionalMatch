# FunctionalMatch

This project aims to provide pattern matching abilities in Python through a query language facility. Given that this query language is ultimately compiled into Python dataclasses, this can be also expressed constructivly in terms of Dataclass objects.

This has the aim to match an object by structure, expand the record of the matched variables, and potentially generate new data out of the elements being provided.
